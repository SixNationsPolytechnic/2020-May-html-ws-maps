  Tip: since we have some debigging issue with the browser you may have to copy code to the index.html ... make sure to copy the coe to indexbak.html / ask instructore for help if you run into issues.

  This is pretty cool stuff call code piese should work there are some excerise in each code /page but we will walk you thru this ... if you get stuck just move to the next one.

  Stop at 4form.html and 7sendmylocation.html and 91sensor.html ... so we can all sync up
